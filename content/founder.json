  "fullBio": "Annie M. Johnson has dedicated her life to serving the Frenchtown community. Born and raised in Tallahassee, Ms. Annie understood firsthand the challenges facing working families - the struggle to find affordable, quality childcare while pursuing education and employment.\n\nIn 2008, she transformed her dream into reality, opening Annie's Nursery School to provide the kind of loving, nurturing environment she wished had been available when she was a young mother.\n\nWhat started as a small childcare center has grown into a community institution. The annual Thanksgiving meal program, volunteer partnerships with local universities, and countless acts of kindness have touched thousands of lives.",
